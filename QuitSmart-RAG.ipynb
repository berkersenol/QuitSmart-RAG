        "This project represents a cutting-edge approach to natural language processing (NLP) by deploying a Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for smoking cessation. Drawing inspiration from the seminal work \"The Easy Way to Stop Smoking\" by Allen Carr, this initiative aims to transform how individuals engage with the process of quitting smoking. By integrating advanced NLP techniques and deep learning, the project offers a novel application that enhances user interaction through personalized and context-aware responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Project utilizes Llama2 (with 13B parameters), Langchain and ChromaDB and FAISS to establish a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This system empowers you to ask questions about your documents, even if the information wasn't included in the training data for the Large Language Model (LLM). Retrieval Augmented Generation works by first performing a retrieval step when presented with a question. This step fetches relevant documents from a special vector database, where the documents have been indexed.\n",

              "Document(page_content=\"13 \\nHowever, I might just as well have been lecturing to a brick wall Since the nicotine chewing -gum \\nand the patch have failed to cure the problem, smokers themselves appear to have accepted tha t \\nyou don't get cured from addiction to a drug by prescribing the same drug. It's equivalent to \\nsaying to a heroin addict: don't smoke heroin, smoking is dangerous, try injecting it into your \\nvein (don't try this with nicotine, it will kill you instantly).  Because the medical profession and \\nthe media haven't a clue about helping smokers to quit, they concentrate on telling smokers what \\nthey already know: smoking is unhealthy, it's filthy and disgusting, it's antisocial and expensive. It \\nnever seems to occur  to them that smokers do not smoke for the reasons that they shouldn't smoke. \\nThe real problem is to remove the reasons that they do smoke.  \\nOn national no -smoking days, the medical experts say something like: This is the day that every \\nsmoker tries to quit !' Every smoker knows that it is the one day in the year that most smokers \\nwill smoke twice as many as they usually do and twice as blatantly, because smokers don't like \\nbeing told what to do, particularly by people who dismiss smokers as mere idiots and d on't \\nunderstand why they smoke.  \\nBecause they don't completely understand smokers themselves or how to make it easy for \\nsmokers to quit, their attitude is 'Try this method. If it doesn't work try another: Can you imagine \\nif there were ten different ways of treating appendicitis? Nine of them cured 10 per cent of the \\npatients, which means they killed 90 per cent of them and the tenth way cured 95 per cent. Imagine \\nthat knowledge of the tenth method had been available for over fourteen years, but the vast \\nmajo rity of the medical profession was still recommending the other nine.  \\nOne of the doctors at the conference raised a very pertinent point that  hadn't occurred to me. He \\npointed out that doctors might well find themselves liable to a legal action for malprac tice, by not \\nadvising their patients of the best way to quit smoking. Ironically he was a great advocate of nicotine \\nreplacement therapy (nicotine gums, patches, etc.), I try hard not to be vindictive, but I hope he \\nbecomes the first victim of his suggesti on. \\nAs I write, the Government has just wasted £2.5 million on a shook TV campaign trying to \\npersuade youngsters not to get hooked. They might just as well have wasted it on trying to persuade \\nthem that motorbikes can kill you. Do they not realize that you ngsters know that one cigarette \\nwon't kill them and that no youngster ever expects to get hooked? The link between smoking and \\nlung cancer has been established for over forty years. Yet more youngsters are becoming hooked \\nnowadays than ever before. Youngst ers don't need to watch smoking horrors on TV. Smokers tend to \\navoid such, programmes any way. Practically every youngster in the country has witnessed the actual \\ndevastation that smoking causes within their own family. I watched my father and my sister de stroyed \\nby the weed; that didn't prevent me from falling into the trap.  \\nI appeared on a national TV programme with a doctor from Ash who had never smoked in her life \\nand had never cured a single smoker, categorically informing the nation how this campaign would \\nprevent youngsters from becoming hooked. If only the government had had the common sense to give \\nthat £2.5 million to me, I could have financed a campaign that would have guaranteed the death of \\nnicotine addiction within a few years.  \\nI truly believe that the snowball has become a football. But after fourteen years that is still a spit \\nin the ocean. I'm grateful to the thousands of ex -smokers who have visited my clinics, read my \\nbooks, watched my videos and recommended EASYWAY to their friends, rela tives and anyone who \\nwill listen to them, and 1 pray that you continue to do so. However, the snowball won't become an\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Allen Carr - The Easy Way to Stop Smoking_ Join the Millions Who Have Become Nonsmokers..-Sterling..-Sterling (2005).pdf', 'page': 12})"

Conversely, ChromaDB, designed for scalable and flexible vector searches, integrates more seamlessly with traditional database management systems, offering robust handling across various computing environments including cloud-based platforms. This makes ChromaDB suitable for enterprise environments where managing a mix of vector and conventional data is crucial."
